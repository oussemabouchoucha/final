# LeadsBuffet

# LeadsBuffet Technical Specification (DRAFT)

## Overview
LeadsBuffet is a Lead Distribution System designed to manage and distribute leads acquired from various sources including LeadsHook. 
The system will offer features such as lead acquisition, enrichment, distribution, buyer management, and comprehensive dashboards for analytics and management. 
The project will be developed using NestJS for the backend and Angular for the frontend, deployed on AWS Cloud using ECS with Fargate.

## System Architecture
### Backend - NestJS
- *Module Structure*: Divide the backend into modules like Lead Management, User Management, Buyer Management, Enrichment Services, and Analytics.
- *Database*: Use AWS Aurora (MySQL compatibility) for relational data. Consider a NoSQL database (like Amazon DynamoDB) for unstructured or semi-structured data if required.
- *Authentication and Authorization*: Implement JWT-based authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
- *API Design*: RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend.

### Frontend - Angular
- *Component Structure*: Organize by feature â€“ e.g., Dashboard, Leads, Buyers, Campaigns.
- *State Management*: Utilize NgRx for efficient state management across the application.
- *Responsive Design*: Ensure UI is responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.

### Deployment and Infrastructure
- *AWS ECS with Fargate*: Containerize the application for deployment.
- *CI/CD Pipeline*: Set up using GitLab CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.
- ** More on the infrastructure will be added as the project progresses.
